Are visitor passes free? How do I get an invitation?",answer:"Yes, admission is free, but entry is by invitation only. Invitations can be requested via the VISIT button on our website.

What is a popup market / popup corner / spot? When does it take place?",answer:"The popup market is a special daytime event held after the main fashion shows (November 10–11, Monday and Tuesday). It features 40 designer collections presented on the runway during the show days, which can be explored, tried on, and purchased. In addition, there are 60 showcase spots for beauty service providers—including nails, hair, skincare, cosmetology, fitness, wellness, clinics, dental studios, salons, and more.",order:3},{id:"faq-4",question:"Beauty Services.

We also host a wide range of beauty service providers: clinics, plastic surgery, botox, fitness, cosmetology, nails, lashes, brows, hair, and styling.",order:4},{id:"faq-5",question:"Dates. 8-9 November: Runways vs 10-11 November: Pop-up & Beauty Market",answer:"On November 8–9 we'll have the evening runway shows — so the audience will be much larger, but they'll be mainly focused on watching the shows continuously. There will be less time and space for visitors to stop by the pop-ups in the corridors. On November 10–11, however, the audience will have the entire day (10 AM – 6 PM) to explore all the stands calmly — to touch the clothes, discover brands, and interact with designers and beauty services. So: 8–9 November: bigger audience, but you'll be competing for attention with the entertainment and runway program. 10–11 November: smaller but more attentive audience, fully dedicated to visiting the market. Also, on November 8–9 we'll feature only about 10–15 brands in the corridors to avoid blocking guest flow, while on November 10–11 we expect around 60 beauty services and 20–40 fashion corners in the main market area.",order:5},{id:"faq-6",question:"Fakes Policy",answer:"We've identified fraudulent accounts and websites impersonating Emirates Fashion Week.
