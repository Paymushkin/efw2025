    question: 'Dates. 8-9 November: Runways vs 10-11 November: Pop-up & Beauty Market',
    answer: 'On November 8–9 we\'ll have the evening runway shows — so the audience will be much larger, but they\'ll be mainly focused on watching the shows continuously. There will be less time and space for visitors to stop by the pop-ups in the corridors. On November 10–11, however, the audience will have the entire day (10 AM – 6 PM) to explore all the stands calmly — to touch the clothes, discover brands, and interact with designers and beauty services. So: 8–9 November: bigger audience, but you\'ll be competing for attention with the entertainment and runway program. 10–11 November: smaller but more attentive audience, fully dedicated to visiting the market. Also, on November 8–9 we\'ll feature only about 10–15 brands in the corridors to avoid blocking guest flow, while on November 10–11 we expect around 60 beauty services and 20–40 fashion corners in the main market area.',
